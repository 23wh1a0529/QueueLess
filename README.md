# QueueLess – Digital Queue Management System

QueueLess is a simple MERN stack web application designed to manage waiting queues digitally.  
It helps users avoid standing in physical lines by providing a digital token system with live queue status.

This repository is currently under initial development and will be updated with features, code, and documentation incrementally.

## 📌 Project Overview
